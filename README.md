Phishing Email Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and mitigate phishing attacks in email communications by analyzing suspicious patterns such as misleading URLs, spoofed sender addresses, and deceptive language. This project uses Python as its core programming language with libraries like Scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas and NumPy for data processing, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. The system is trained on a dataset containing email samples labeled as "phishing" or "legitimate," with features extracted from URLs, sender metadata, and email content to build an accurate classification model. The detection framework provides real-time predictions and is suitable for large-scale applications, offering a robust solution to combat cybersecurity threats. To set up the project, clone the repository from GitHub and install the necessary Python libraries. We extend our gratitude to Poornima University for supporting this initiative and to our mentor, Mr. Abhishek Kumar Singh, for his guidance.
